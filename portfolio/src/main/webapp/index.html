        <h2>Experience</h2>
          <p>I've started studying algorithms and data structures in C++ 7 years ago.</p>
          <p>In 2018 I decided that I want to discover more about Computer Science, 
            so I spent the summer at a local software company to learn about web development:
            both the front-end and the back-end parts using JavaScript and Node.js.</p>
          <p>This year I've discovered three more programming languages: During my first year at University I've had a course in Java and one in Ocaml,
            while also working on several small projects in Java and Python. C++ remains my favourite programming language,
            but I found JavaScript intriguing after all those years of strongly-typed coding.
          </p>
          <p>I want to dive deeper into a lot of parts of Computer Science, such as Data Science and Security. I'm looking forward to the second year of 
            my degree, and I really hope the pandemic won't affect my studies.
